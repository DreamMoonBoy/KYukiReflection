üå¥Ô∏è An efficient Reflection API for the Android platform built in Kotlin.
<br/>

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/fankes/YukiReflection/blob/master/README-zh-CN.md)

## What's this

- This is a concise and efficient Reflection API rebuilt based on Java's native Reflection API using Kotlin, and it is also the core function
  being used by [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/fankes/YukiHookAPI)
- The name is taken from ["„ÇÇ„ÇÇ„Åè„Çä" heroine Yuki Kurihara](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss5016)

## What it can do

- Instead of Java's native Reflection API, use a more user-friendly language to implement a more complete set of reflection solutions
- Use annotations to declare classes, methods, and fields that need reflection, construct a `stub`, and call directly to achieve the same
  function as the Reflection API, which is more elegant and efficient (under development, and it is expected to gradually implement this function
  later)
